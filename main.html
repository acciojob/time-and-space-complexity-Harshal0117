    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity for the given input size.</p>
    <p>Space complexity measures the total memory space required by an algorithm to complete its execution. It is often expressed as O(n), where n is the input size. The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is an essential factor in evaluating its performance.</p>
